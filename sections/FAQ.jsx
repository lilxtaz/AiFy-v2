                The OpenAI API has a pricing plan and our expanding customer base is making it hard for us to provide our services and keep up with the charges. Hence, we 
                implement advertisements to pay off the pricing plans and continue to provide you our services making them better everyday. You can remove the advertisements 
                by generating your own API key and setting it up in the 'Settings' tab of the application. Or we are currently working on pricing plans
                where you can remove the advertisements and enroll for much more premium services.

                Absolutely!<br></br> <br></br> AiFy has a TTS model implemented in it, which allows it to intelligently convert the text into a voice over enhancing the User Experience. 
                After generating the response you can tap on the ðŸ”‰ icon to let AiFy voice the text.

                Yes!<br></br> <br></br> AiFy can listen to the User through the microphone actively converting speech to text and processing the data.
                The generated text can be used to produce responses for further use.
                <br></br><br></br>
                NOTE: The Speech-to-Text model will be upgraded using the Whisper API in the future updates to give a better User Experience and further polish the generated texts to be more accurate.

                  <li>The microphone might be disabled. You can change it by going into your device settings and allowing microphone access in the 'AiFy' application accessibility settings.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li>Check for updates. The TTS model is updated frequently to further reduce bugs. Try updating 'AiFy' in the Play Store.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li>Try disconnecting any Bluetooth devices. Due to different factors the application might be using the bluetooth device as audio input. If the bluetooth
                  device does not have a microphone, then no audio input is passed to the application.

                All the search history is stored on your device's local storage and we have no way to access or manipulate your presonal data. The search history can be deleted by clearing the cache for the 'AiFy' application.
                We have very strict data privacy regulations and we have many safeguards to avoid any collection of sensitive data.
